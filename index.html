      I don't know why the overflow scroll isn't working, now the track is
      float:right;, and it won't scroll becuase of that, but if I do either no
      float or float:left; then it will scroll, but then you can't see the bars
      start until they come into line of view, or if you scroll. I even tried to
      transform translate the track so that it will be in positon. But it's not
      wokring.

      So, if you look with inspecor you can see that there's actually 40 items,
      continualsy beign created and pop()-ed out.
