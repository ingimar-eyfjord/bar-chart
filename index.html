    <p>Two things:</p>
    <p>
      1: I don't know why the overflow scroll isn't working, now the track is
      float:right;, and it won't scroll becuase of that, but if I do either no
      float or float:left; then it will scroll, but then you can't see the bars
      start until they come into line of view, or if you scroll. I even tried to
      transform translate the track so that it will be in positon. But it's not
      wokring.
      <br />
      So, if you look with inspecor you can see that there's actually 40 items,
      continualsy beign created and pop()-ed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      2: the way I'm doing the JS appending the innnerHTML makes the animation
      clunky, since it's appending all the bars at the same time again and
      again. I will fix this if I have time.
